## About Me
ðŸ’« - I started in high school not really knowing what i wanted to do, 
I joined my school's Cisco Networking program because it was the 
only computer centric course available to me. I quickly realized 
that networking was not for me as I enjoy doing something a 
little more creative and loose. I got a job as a restaurant 
shift leader to fund my self taught web development journey. <br>

ðŸ’« - I also wasn't sure if this was for me, but i fell in love with the idea of using web development as a medium for my ideas.
In 2018, I made the decision to take a leap into learning web development and transition away from my apprenticeship in 
system administration. Since then, I've been actively exploring new technologies and acquiring skills to effectively transform abstract concepts into tangible realities. 

ðŸ’« - I'm a passionate and creative individual with a diverse range of interests beyond the world of coding. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me exploring my other passions in msuic and web design
