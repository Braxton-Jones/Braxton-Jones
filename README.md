<p>I started in high school not really knowing what i wanted to do, I joined my school's Cisco Networking program because it was the only computer centric course available to me. I quickly realized that networking was not for me as I enjoy doing something a little more creative and loose. I got a job as a restaurant shift leader to fund my self taught web development journey. I also wasn't sure if this was for me, but i fell in love with the idea of using web development as a medium for my ideas. In 2018, I made the decision to take a 
					leap into learning web development and 
					transition away from my apprenticeship in 
					system administration. Since then, I've 
					been actively exploring new technologies and 
					acquiring skills to effectively transform 
					abstract concepts into tangible realities. </p>
